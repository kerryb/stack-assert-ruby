My attempt at Corey Haines's exercise to create a stack using TDD, but without a test framework.

I [tried it in Java](https://github.com/kerryb/stack-assert-java) too.

This branch adds an extra constraint ((Thanks Corey!)[https://twitter.com/coreyhaines/status/482896087603093504])
-- only add code when the tests are red, and remove it when they're green.
